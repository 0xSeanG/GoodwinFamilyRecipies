# Traeger Chocolate Chip Cookies

In a very non-standard initiation of our new Traeger grill, we fired up some chocolate chip cookies with pecan pellets.

### Ingredients

* 1 Cup cold unsalted butter
* 1 Cup brown sugar
* 1/2 Cup granulated sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2 Teaspoon vanilla
* 3 Cup all-purpose flour
* 1 Teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 Teaspoon baking soda
* 2 Teaspoon  Sea Salt
* 1 1/2 Cup dark chocolate chips
* Additional Sea Salt for topping (optional)

### Instructions

* Preheat to 350\*F
* Mix the butter and all the sugar in a mixer until everything is blended well
* Add the eggs 1 at a time
* Add the vanilla
* In a separate bowl, mix all dry ingredients
* Slowly add the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl
* Stop the mixer (if using one) and mix in the chocolate chips by hand
* Scoop out the cookies and place on cookie sheet(s) - sprinkle with additional salt if desired

### Modifications

The next time I try these, I'll be using a cooler temperature in exchange for a bit more time on the grill. The bottoms of these were a bit too burnt for my liking. I would also make them much smaller - the original recipe called for larger cookies to keep the softer center, which I like - but these things were massive.

I would also plan to check on them about 15 minutes in and consider rotating the cookie sheet - the heat distribution was not skewed a crazy amount, but there was a slight difference between opposite corners.

Overall these were a hit - the pecan pellets added a slight smoked flavor, but it was certainly not overpowering by any means.

The Traeger recipe can be found here. This is nice for the lazy cooks like me because you can drag the serving size calculator to auto-update measurements.
